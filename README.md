## 🔑 Getting Your OpenAI API Key

Before you can start generating cute images, you'll need an OpenAI API key. Here's how to get one:

1. Visit [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in: If you don't have an account, click "Sign up" and create one. If you already have an account, click "Log in".
3. Navigate to API keys: Once logged in, look for your account name or icon in the top-right corner of the page. Click on it to open a dropdown menu.
4. Select "Your Profile".
5. Select "User API keys".
6. Create a new API key: Look for a button that says "Create new secret key" or "+ New secret key".
7. Name your key (optional): You may have the option to give your API key a name.
8. Copy and save your API key: After creating the key, you'll see it displayed once. **Make sure to copy it immediately and store it securely, as you won't be able to see it again.**
9. Set up billing: Before you can use your API key, you need to set up billing. Look for a "Billing" or "Payment" section in the account settings or main menu.
10. Set usage limits (optional): In the billing section, you may be able to set usage limits to control your spending.
